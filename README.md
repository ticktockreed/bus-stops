`|-- scripts` contains ALL javascript files.

`|-- snippets` contains HTML snippets.*

`|-- styles` contains all assets used in styling the site; CSS, SASS, SVG, images etc.

`|-- favicon.ico` is the basic favicon for the site - don't forget it.

`|-- humans.txt` tells us who has worked on the project, who helped, and what technologies were used.

`|-- index.html` is the basic page markup (distilled from the HTML5 Boilerplate).

** Please view README.md files within each folder for more info **

## Setting up the project
`|-- package.json` contains all the dependencies you'll need to  develop locally. Run `npm install --save-dev` to install all the grunt modules you require. The flag `--save-dev` means that anyone  installing the modules on their machine will install exactly the same ones you have.
