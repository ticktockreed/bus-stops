`|-- scripts` contains ALL javascript files.

`|-- styles` contains all assets used in styling the site; CSS, SASS, SVG, images etc.

`|-- favicon.ico` is the basic favicon for the site - don't forget it.

`|-- humans.txt` tells us who has worked on the project, who helped, and what technologies were used.

`|-- index.html` is the basic page markup (distilled from the HTML5 Boilerplate).

`|-- references.md` is a list of links researched to inform this template

** Please view README.md files within each folder for more info **
