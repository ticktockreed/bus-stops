## Setting up the project

|-- package.json is set to install the latest module versions compatible with grunt~0.4.1.

*Run (in this directory):*

    npm install

This will install all the node modules you require.

*Run (in this directory):* 

    bower install

This will install all the required library dependencies.

*To begin working on the project run:*

    grunt watch 


## Installing new packages

**For new Grunt modules run:**

	npm install <package name> --save-dev
	
The flag `--save-dev` will save the version number to package.json so that everyone has the same versions.

**For new Bower components run:**

	bower install <package>#<version> --save-dev
