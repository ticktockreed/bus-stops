# Zone Boilerplate #

This is the base repo for all Zone templates.

The snippets need to be just HTML with meaningful text inside the elements.
Keep the markup as lean as possible. ONLY the bare essentials.
Don't worry too much about classes, but do use them to add further meaning to the elements.

Please comment at the top of the file suggesting the snippets use and any interesting information.

We'll open these up to discussion within codebase.
We'll open up discussion about each file within the discussions tab of the repository in codebase.
